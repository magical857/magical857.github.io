## WHY
Well, there are many many things that have have a strong motivation of making me to build a blog. For one thing, I have a powerfull curiosity about the beautiful thing like this nice blog and I think that have a customizable blog so cool.Another most important thing is that since there are many things needed to learn so that forgetting is not a surprise thing,someone may want to say something that you can search it by brower, AI, and so on.That is good way to help us do work (e.g. coding) and I often used to do that.However,The bad thing for me is that I can't remmber anything when I need to do some similar thing over and over time.so I need to record these knowledge with my notebook.I had do that many times but I have a bad habit of collecting them and clasifying them tidearly. Because of that, I can't find find information quickly and easily which I need. So I decided to build this blog to solve that problem.
## What
I plan to make this blog useful for recording knowledge about my study and research. But also publishing something that I want to say, do, and think.
